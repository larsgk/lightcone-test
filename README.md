# Simple 'light cone' on canvas test

I wanted to try to read the events from the Pixelbook pen and ended up doing a small demo, where the pen can act as a flashlight that will 'light up' an area on a background image, using the tilt and pressure to control direction and size of the 'light cone'.

The event handlers will also accept touch and mouse so it's not *all* dark for people without a pen :)
